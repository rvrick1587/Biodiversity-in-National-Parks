Biodiversity in National Parks through CodeCademy - Data Science: Analytics Specialist Career Path

# Goals of this Project
Within this project, the goal is to analyze data from the National Parks Service regarding different species of animals and plants observed throughout different national park locations.

Through the analysis of the provided data sets, I will seek to answer the following questions:
+ What is the distribution of conservation status for animals?
+ Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
+ Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?
+ Which species were spotted the most at each park?
